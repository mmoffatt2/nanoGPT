# Vector Distribution Analysis Output Files

This directory contains the output files generated by the vector distribution analysis scripts.

## Using the Interactive HTML Files

All `.html` files in this directory are interactive 3D visualizations created with Plotly and HEALPix:

### Features
- **3D Sphere Visualization**: Shows the unit sphere with vector density mapped as color intensity
- **Interactive Controls**: 
  - Rotate the sphere by clicking and dragging
  - Zoom in/out with mouse wheel
  - Pan by right-clicking and dragging
- **Color Scale**: Hot colormap showing density (brighter = higher density)
- **Coordinate Axes**: Red (X), Green (Y), Blue (Z) arrows for orientation

### Opening Files
1. Open any `.html` file in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
2. The visualization will load automatically
3. Use mouse controls to explore the 3D space

### Interpretation
- **Bright regions**: Areas where many quantized vectors point
- **Dark regions**: Areas with few or no quantized vectors
- **Patterns**: Reveal how different number formats distribute vectors on the sphere
- **Symmetry**: Integer formats often show symmetric patterns
- **Clustering**: Floating-point formats may show clustering around certain directions

## File Sizes

Note that these files are large (300+ MB each) because they contain:
- High-resolution HEALPix mesh data
- Interactive 3D visualization code
- Complete vector distribution data

## Generating New Files

To create additional visualizations, run:
```sh
# From the parent directory
python3 vector_distribution_analysis.py --format <format> --mode <mode> --healpix --nside <resolution> --out3d images/<filename>.html
```

## Analysis Insights

These visualizations help understand:
- How quantization affects vector distributions (int vs floating point)
- Impact of bit precision (mantissa vs exponent) on representable directions
- Symmetry and clustering patterns in quantized spaces that can be extrapolated and tested in higher dimensions
